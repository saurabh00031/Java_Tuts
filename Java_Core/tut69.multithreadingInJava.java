/*


  Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.
  Threads can be created by using two mechanisms : 

 `1)Extending the Thread class...

 `2)Implementing the Runnable Interface...

/*

In a nut shell  -->


* Threads uses shared memory area...........
* Threads-->faster context switching.............
* Thread-->light weighted whereas a process is heavy weight...........
